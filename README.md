# AWS Study Hall

## Some Simple AWS CLI based projects while I am out

### Repo Setup:

This repo is divided into folders that feature a topic of AWS and an exercise. These are meant to build on your Cloud9 IDE. Drop into a folder like `s3` and view the README.md to see the exercise.

If an exercise README.md has *Work in Progress* at the top it is not complete yet and might not work for you all the way.
